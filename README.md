# pulumi_workshops

Work in progress, but the intent is to provide artifacts that can be used with `pulumi new <url>` as part of hands-on sessions so as to avoid having to do a lot of typing or copy/pasting.

Each subfolder is for a different workshop.

Each subfolder under the workshop folder contains files that can be grabbed using `pulumi new <url>` so as to act as a template for a given hands-on session of the workshop.
